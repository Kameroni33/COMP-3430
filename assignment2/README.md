# COMP 3430 - Assignment 2

## Compilation & Execution

```shell
make        # compile all executables & generate folders
make clean  # remove compiled executables & remove folders
```

```shell
# Question 1
./serial ~comp3430/shared/a2_files/*.txt
# Question 2
./withLocks numWorkers ~comp3430/shared/a2_files/*.txt
# Question 3
./withFIFOs numWorkers ~comp3430/shared/a2_files/*.txt
```

**numWorkers** must be a numeric value indicating the number of worker threads to generate.

Additionally, for questions 1 & 2, the main process uses a Job buffer/queue to supply the worker threads with Jobs. By default the buffer size is 10, but can be changed by editing the value **BUFFER_SIZE** in *a2Utils*:

```c
// Global Constants ===================================================================

#define NUM_OUTPUTS 27  // number of output files (a-z + other)
#define BUFFER_SIZE 10  // size of Job Buffer

#define MAX_WORD 100    // max character count for words in input files
#define MAX_NAME 100    // max character count for input file names
```

## Other files

The file *a2Utils.c* contains central code for all 3 questions (plus a bit extra). There is also a header file *a2Utils.h* so that it can be included as a library in each of the questions 'main' functions.

The shell script *test.sh* 

The python scripts *graph.py* 

## Temp Folders

Temporary *output*, *fifo*, and *log* folders can be generated by running `make folders`. By default they are generated in:

```
/tmp/ronaldk1/output
/tmp/ronaldk1/fifo
/tmp/ronaldk1/log
```

This can be changed by editing the values **outputDir** and **fifoDir** in *a2Utils*:

```c
// Global Variables ===================================================================

const char outputDir[] = "/tmp/ronaldk1/output/";
const char fifoDir[] = "/tmp/ronaldk1/fifo/";
const char logDir[] = "/tmp/ronaldk1/log/";
```
