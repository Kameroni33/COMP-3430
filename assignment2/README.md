# COMP 3430 - Assignment 2

## Compilation & Execution

```shell
make        # compile all executables & generate output/fifos folders
make clean  # remove compiled executables & remove output/fifos folders
```

```shell
# Question 1
./serial input/*.txt
# Question 2
./withLocks numWorkers input/*.txt
# Question 3
./withFIFOs numWorkers input/*.txt
```

**numWorkers** must be a numeric value indicating the number of worker threads to generate.

Additionally, for questions 1 & 2, the main process uses a JobBuffer to supply the worker threads with Jobs. By default the buffer size is 10.

## Required Folders

```
├── input
├── output
└── fifos
```

The *output* & *fifos* folders can be generated by running `make folders`.

The *input* folder must be created and populated with *.txt* files. Due to the size of the example *input* folder, it has not been included with the submission.
