# COMP 3430 - Assignment 2

## Compilation & Execution

```shell
make        # compile all executables & generate output/fifos folders
make clean  # remove compiled executables & remove output/fifos folders
```

```shell
# Question 1
./serial ~comp3430/shared/a2_files/*.txt
# Question 2
./withLocks numWorkers input/*.txt
# Question 3
./withFIFOs numWorkers input/*.txt
```

**numWorkers** must be a numeric value indicating the number of worker threads to generate.

Additionally, for questions 1 & 2, the main process uses a JobBuffer to supply the worker threads with Jobs. By default the buffer size is 10.

## a2Utils.c

The file *a2Utils.c* contains central code for all 3 questions (and other useful functions). There is also a header file included so that it can be included as a library in each of the wuestions 'main' functions.

## Temp Folders

Temporary *output* & *fifos* folders can be generated by running `make folders`. By default they are generated in:

```
/tmp/ronaldk1/output
/tmp/ronaldk1/fifos
```

This can be changed
